# Express-Box
To Be Used as Truffle Box Creating API Endpoints for 
Ethereum Blockchain.

We use personalised blockchain for Ethereum BlockChain
Development. This personalised blockchain is made in the
GanacheCLI.

The Smart Contract Written in solidity language
is deployed on this blockchain. Smart Contract is
Immutable hence, once deployed it can't be changed.

This Box Uses NodeJS(Express JS) to provide API 
endpoints to the blockchain smart contract so that this
smart contract can be used in Android Apps as well.
